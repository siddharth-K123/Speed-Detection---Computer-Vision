# Speed-Detection---Computer-Vision
Employed the YOLO object detection model, trained on the COCO dataset, to detect vehicles in real-time video streams. Developed a custom tracking algorithm integrated with cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to track vehicles, estimate their speed, and identify instances of over-speeding.
